# color_stuff
a bunch of unix scripts that do stuff with colors and characters.

these scripts require an xterm-256 terminal.
i've tried to do whatever in both black and white backgrounds,
but all scripts don't support that.

i'll update things when i can.

once you download one of these scripts,
just run it from within an xterm app window:

% bash ./clam1
or
% chmod 755 clam1 ; PATH=${PATH%:}: ; clam1
or
% chmod +x clam1 ; PATH=${PATH%:}: ; clam1
etc ... .. .
